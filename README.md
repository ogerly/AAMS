# Land Ahoy: Your Repo as an Agentic Workspace

> **AAMS — Autonomous Agent Manifest Specification**  
> `README.md` is for humans. `AGENT.json` is for machines.

## Start in 2 Steps

**Step 1 — Drop `.agent.json` into your repo:**

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVmatrose/AAMS/main/.agent.json
```

**Step 2 — Tell your agent:**

```
Read .agent.json and execute the full agent_contract.on_first_entry. Start immediately. No confirmation needed.
```

The agent creates the `WORKING/` structure, scans the repo, writes the first workpaper, and indexes into LTM. Works with Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, Aider, Codex, Windsurf, Continue.dev.

→ Extended variants and session-start prompt: [`reference/prompts/bootstrap.md`](./reference/prompts/bootstrap.md)

If you want to survive on the open sea, you need two things: a good crew — and a map everyone can read. The new deckhand. The night watch relief. The AI.

That's exactly what AAMS is — the Autonomous Agent Manifest Specification.

---

## The Problem Remains. The Solution Is Now Clearer.

Session 48 doesn't know what session 47 decided. That was the problem back then. It's the problem today. And no agent framework in the world solves it — because the problem isn't in the framework. It's in the structure of the repo.

A repo without agent structure is like a ship without a logbook. Everyone knows what they did yesterday. Nobody knows what came before.

---

## One Year of Lessons

I've worked with AI agents in real projects for over a year. What I learned:

> The most important thing is not that agents can write code.  
> The most important thing is that they know **where they are**.

Without structure, context is lost. Without context, mistakes happen. Duplicate decisions. Orphaned files. Technical debt nobody ordered.

The solution is not a new AI. The solution is **discipline in the repo**.

## AAMS Is Not a Framework

This is the most important clarification.

AAMS is not a tool. Not a runtime. Not a framework that needs to be installed.

AAMS is a **single file** dropped into any repo:

```
.agent.json
```

An agent that reads this file immediately knows:

- Where documentation belongs
- How sessions are structured
- Where long-term memory lives
- What it's allowed to do — and what it's not

No `npm install`. No `pip install`. No setup.

---

## Works With Every Agent. Not Just One.

Cursor has `.cursorrules`. Copilot has `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Claude Code has `CLAUDE.md`. Codex has `AGENTS.md`. Windsurf has `.windsurfrules`.

Every tool has its own convention. If you commit to one, you lock out the others.

AAMS solves this with a single bridge file:

```
AGENTS.md  ←  read by all major AI tools
    ↓
READ-AGENT.md  ←  project context and agent contract
    ↓
.agent.json    ←  bootstrap rules and workspace structure
```

One setup. Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf, Aider, Continue.dev — they all read `AGENTS.md`. From there, they reach the same contract. No duplication. No tool lock-in.

**No CLAUDE.md. No GEMINI.md. No airules.md needed.**

| Tool-specific file | Tool | Replaced by AAMS |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code | `AGENTS.md` → `READ-AGENT.md` → `.agent.json` |
| `GEMINI.md` | Firebase Studio / Gemini | `AGENTS.md` → `.agent.json` |
| `.idx/airules.md` | Firebase Studio | `AGENTS.md` → `READ-AGENT.md` |
| `.cursorrules` | Cursor | `AGENTS.md` → `.agent.json` |
| `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf | `AGENTS.md` → `.agent.json` |

One set of files. All tools. When the rules change, update one place — not five.

Long tool-specific files (e.g. `CLAUDE.md` >150 lines) are widely reported to hurt answer quality and increase hallucinations. AAMS avoids this by design: `AGENTS.md` stays thin and delegates to structured contracts, not system-prompt-sized instruction blocks.

**That's the actual differentiator.** Not the folder structure. The portability.

---

## Which File Do I Need?

**For end users: exactly one.**

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVmatrose/AAMS/main/.agent.json
```

That's `.agent.json`. Drop it into your repo root. Done. The rest is reference material for contributors, framework builders, and tool integrators.

| File | Who it's for | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `.agent.json` | **Everyone** | The one file you actually need. Drop into any repo. |
| `AGENTS.md` | AI tools auto-reading on entry | Bridge file. Routes Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, Windsurf to the agent contract. |
| `reference/AGENT.json` | Framework builders / harness devs | Fully annotated reference manifest. All fields, all options, all defaults. |
| `reference/SPEC.md` | Implementers / contributors | The normative specification. 1,070+ lines. Every field defined. |

**Starting a new project?** `.agent.json`. Done.

**Onboarding an existing project?** Fill out `reference/templates/project-analysis-template.md` first — it captures repo topology, existing tools, LTM state, and conventions before you write a single line of manifest.

**Building a framework or harness?** Use `reference/AGENT.json` as the reference manifest.

**Working with Copilot, Cursor, etc.?** `AGENTS.md` in the root is all you need — it routes them to the rest automatically.

## The Four-Layer Documentation Model

The actual core of AAMS. Four layers, mandatory:

**Workpaper** — What am I doing in this session?  
Created at session start, archived at session end. With a complete file protocol: what was created, changed, deleted.

**Whitepaper** — How is this system built?  
Stable architecture truth. Written once, updated only on architecture decisions. Never deleted.

**Long-Term Memory** — What have we learned over time?  
After every session the workpaper is ingested into LTM. Session N+1 queries LTM before starting. Each session builds on the last.

```
WORKING/
├── WHITEPAPER/       ← Stable system truth. Never delete.
├── WORKPAPER/        ← Active session work. One file per session.
│   └── closed/        ← Archived completed sessions.
├── DIARY/            ← Temporal context. Why did we decide this? Monthly files.
├── MEMORY/           ← Human-readable audit log. In Git. Always.
└── AGENT-MEMORY/     ← Vector store (ChromaDB). Queryable LTM. In .gitignore.
```

**Diary layer** — the gap between workpaper and whitepaper. Decisions have context that's too narrative for a whitepaper and too strategic for a workpaper. The diary preserves that — chronologically, monthly, max 10 lines per entry.

Two LTM tracks, both mandatory: the **audit log** (`ltm-index.md`) is what humans read and what survives a fresh clone. The **vector store** (`AGENT-MEMORY/`) is what agents query efficiently. Without the vector store, context degrades after ~100 sessions. Without the audit log, a fresh clone starts blind.

**LTM Setup Order — start here, not with ChromaDB:**

| Step | What | Why |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Create `WORKING/MEMORY/ltm-index.md` | Zero dependencies. Human-readable. In Git. Survives fresh clone. Append after every session close. |
| 2 | Set up ChromaDB *(optional)* | Semantic search. Essential at ~100 sessions. Requires `pip install chromadb`. Rebuilt from `ltm-index.md` if lost. |

`ltm-index.md` is the source of truth. Always set it up first.

---

## The Agent Contract

A `READ-AGENT.md` in the repo root defines the normative contract for every agent entering this repo.

Any agent entering this repo executes this contract. No discussion. No interpretation.

```
On first entry:       Read READ-AGENT.md → check structure → scan repo → index into MEMORY/
On session start:     Read READ-AGENT.md → check last workpaper → query MEMORY/
On session end:       Complete workpaper → ingest → move to closed/ → update READ-AGENT.md
```

Works with any agent framework. And without any framework.

---

## What AAMS Can and Cannot Do

This is an honest account. Not a sales pitch.

**AAMS works well when the agent operates autonomously.**

Aider, Claude Code, Codex — tools that read a repo and act without waiting for human confirmation. These agents scan files, follow imperative instructions, and execute contracts. For them, the signals in `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `READ-AGENT.md` are sufficient: they read, they act.

**AAMS cannot force a chat agent to execute anything.**

Copilot in chat mode, ChatGPT, or any assistant that responds to user questions — these agents act on the user's prompt, not on files in a repo. No matter how imperative the language in `README.md` is, a chat agent won't bootstrap a workspace unless the user asks it to. The user prompt is the only lever.

| Agent mode | AAMS signal works? | What triggers execution |
|---|---|---|
| Autonomous (Aider, Claude Code, Codex) | ✅ Yes | Reading the repo |
| Chat with repo context (Cursor, Copilot Agent) | ✅ Mostly | Reading the repo + open workspace |
| Pure chat (Copilot Chat, ChatGPT) | ⚠ Partially | User must ask explicitly |

**The gap is real. We are working on it.**

The long-term goal is a mechanism that causes any agent — chat or autonomous — to recognize an AAMS repo and execute the contract without requiring a special user prompt. This is an open research and design problem. Current directions under investigation:

- System prompt injection via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and equivalent per-tool files
- A bootstrap prompt library ([`reference/prompts/bootstrap.md`](./reference/prompts/bootstrap.md)) for users to hand to chat agents
- Standardized `on_entry` signals that agent runtimes could recognize natively

Until that problem is solved: for chat agents, the user prompt from [`reference/prompts/bootstrap.md`](./reference/prompts/bootstrap.md) is the bridge.

---

## Portable Into Any Repo

The decisive design goal: **one file, every repo**.

Does a developer have their own agent framework? Their framework recognizes the `WORKING/` structure and uses it directly as a subagent workspace.

Does a developer have no framework? `.agent.json` + `READ-AGENT.md` are the smallest possible agent framework — declarative, idempotent, zero dependencies.

Long-term goal: AAMS becomes the de-facto standard that every agent recognizes in every repo.

---

## Applied to Itself

This project — the project that describes the standard — built its own workspace using AAMS on day one.

One `.agent.json` read. Structure created. First workpaper written. First whitepaper written. LTM populated. Three open GitHub issues resolved. All of it documented, traceable, reproducible.

That's not proof that AAMS works at scale, in legacy repos, or with uncooperative agents. It's a working example of the workflow — what a session looks like, what gets created, what survives into the next session.

The real test is your project.

### Why is WORKING/ in this repo?

This repo contains a `WORKING/` folder that looks like it belongs to an active project — because it does. It's the live workspace of this project, generated by the AAMS bootstrap process itself.

It exists here intentionally:

- **As proof** — everything in `WORKING/WORKPAPER/closed/` and `WORKING/MEMORY/ltm-index.md` is the actual documented history of building this standard
- **As reference** — contributors and implementers can see exactly what a real AAMS workspace looks like after 10+ sessions
- **For collaboration** — `WORKING/MEMORY/ltm-index.md` is the audit log that keeps any collaborator (human or AI) from starting blind

The vector store (`WORKING/AGENT-MEMORY/`) is excluded via `.gitignore` — it's rebuilt locally. The audit log is always in Git.
